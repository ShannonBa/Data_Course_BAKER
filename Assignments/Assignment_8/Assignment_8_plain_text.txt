1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
According to the summary(mod16), Nigroten, HumidityLow:Nitrogen, and Light:HumidityLow:Nitrogen were not statistically significant. 
Other models, such as my mod12, also did not show significantce with Nitrogen. On the Nitrogen vs GrowthRate graph,
it did show that about 20 units of Nitrogen produced the highest GrowthRate, but perhaps the models did not see this
as statistically significant to the overall growth rate. Perhaps the mushrooms are getting their nitrogen from a different
source or too much nitrogen is not bad for mushrooms.


2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to 
at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
The Nitrogen relationship is non-linear. It is more bell-curved shaped.

3. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear 
model (there are a few ways of doing this)

#model for linear model
new <- read.csv("../../Data/non_linear_relationship.csv")

#option 1
ggplot (new, aes(y=response, x=predictor)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

#option 2
ggplot (new, aes(y=response, x=predictor)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

#option 3
ggplot (new, aes(y=response, x=predictor)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ splines::bs(x, df = 3))

#option 4
ggplot (new, aes(y=response, x=predictor)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 5, raw = TRUE))
