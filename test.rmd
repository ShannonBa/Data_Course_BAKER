## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(Rpdb)
library(janitor)
library(plotly)
library()
```

This is a collaberation with [Young Living Essential Oil.](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US)

```{r,message=FALSE
```
BROC <- read.pdb("./1HXB hiv b with sqv_NO_BROC")
df<-BROC[!(BROC1=="BROC",]

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df <- read_csv("./Data/Juniper_Oils.csv")
names(df) <- names(df)%>% make_clean_names()
names(df)

compounds <- names(df)[11:33]
#df%>% pivot_longer(compounds)
long <- df %>%
  filter(amplicon == "16S" )%>%
  pivot_longer(compounds,names_to="compound",values_to="yield")

glimpse(long)
```
#now that cleaned up a bit, we can plot the compound yields over time since burn...

___
```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
summeraized_compound <- long %>%
  group_by(compound()) %>%
  summarize(MeanConcnetration = mean(yield))

knitr::kable(summarized_compound, row.names=FALSE, digits=4, caption= "Mean concnetration values across entire study")
```




```{r}


p1 <- ggplot(long, aes(x-years_since_burn, y=yield))+
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~compounds,scales="free")
```

#on hashtag means big, bold est
#Juniper Oil Initial Analysis

___ 
three underscores gives a page break


**this uses the "plotly packate

```{r}
ggplotly(p1)
```


You don't need to show the code if not necessary

```{r echo=FALSE}
-can name the code, can show the code, can hide the code and show only the output in the 'setting' tab
-knit is ctrl + shift + k
